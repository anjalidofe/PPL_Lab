1 )   Array declarations and initialization are separated out into different 
     lines with only one declaration or initialization on a line. This is done for 
     better readability and understanding of the code and its implementation.

2 )    The step a[i] = b[i] gets split up into two steps with an intermediate temporary
     for better understanding and also to simplify the process and understand how it actually works.

3 )    CLOBBER statements are at the end. In computer or software engineering, clobbering
    a file or computer memory is overwriting its contents. Clobber descriptions in any way 
    may not overlap with an input or output operand.

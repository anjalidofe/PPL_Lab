1)  We notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
    suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment. Some variables
    have a suffix `(D)' in which The contents of definition are tokenized
    and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a
   ‘#define’ directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by embedded 
   newline characters.

2)   Since it is not possible to determine which of the three branches will be 
   taken at runtime, we don’t know which of a_1, a_2 or a_3 to use at the return statement.
          So, the SSA renamer creates a new version a_4 which is assigned the result of
   “merging” a_1, a_2 and a_3. Hence, PHI nodes mean “one of these operands. I don’t know which”.
          It is this line at which a and b merge :  # a_1 = PHI <a_7(3), a_5(4)>
                                                    # b_2 = PHI <b_8(3), b_6(4)>

3)  For example, consider the following code:
          1	L0:
          2	x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
          3	if (x_1 < 10)
          4	  if (x_1 > 7)
          5	    y_2 = 0
          6	  else
          7	    y_3 = x_1 + x_7
          8	  endif
          9	  x_5 = x_1 + 1
          10   goto L0;
          11	endif

Suppose that we insert new names x_10 and x_11 (lines 4 and 8).
          1	L0:
          2	x_1 = PHI (0, x_5)
          3	if (x_1 < 10)
          4	  x_10 = ...
          5	  if (x_1 > 7)
          6	    y_2 = 0
          7	  else
          8	    x_11 = ...
          9	    y_3 = x_1 + x_7
          10	  endif
          11	  x_5 = x_1 + 1
          12	  goto L0;
          13	endif

We want to replace all the uses of x_1 with the new definitions of x_10 and x_11. 
Note that the only uses that should be replaced are those at lines 5, 9 and 11. Also, 
the use of x_7 at line 9 should not be replaced (this is why we cannot just mark symbol x for renaming).
Additionally, we may need to insert a PHI node at line 11 because that is a merge point for x_10 and x_11. So the use of x_1 at line 11 will be replaced with the new PHI node. The insertion of PHI nodes is optional. They are not strictly necessary to preserve the SSA form, and depending on what the caller inserted, they may not even be useful for the optimizers.

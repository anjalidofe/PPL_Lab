1) The variables are defined over multiple lines.
  Even if in the program they are defined on one line;
  gimple will show them on different lines. int a,b,c diaplayed as
          int a;
          int b;
          int c;

2)  In the expression c=a*b+25
     Now a*b is not assigned any variable ,the compiler then introduces 
     a temporary variable _1 to store it.And then this value is replaced in the 
    orignal expression like this:
         c=_1+25:SO smaller parts of expression are assigned a temp variable.

3) r=34.5 this is value of r it is represented in the exponential form like 3.45e+1.
    When a float/double value is assigned to an int a new variuable is created_var that
         stores the int value and then it is assigned to the required variable.

4) The global variable is not declared before the main function in gimple it is 
   automatically declared when it is given a particular value(that is when initialized).
   Z is given a temporary value because in the expression Z=Z+1 its value is being modified,
   so just to store orignal value.
